* to made representation by synced loop or cycle configurable and optional
* to add support for buttons which produce two states (0 & 1) for press and release so it won't be triggered twice if not wanted
* to change lists (ie. slwets, slloopnums...) with nicer and more elegant configurations...
* to make version where there is a master CycleTime so it is separated from loops
  * to make CycleTime ring for loop just in case it's cycle is different from master one
* to clean up git repository
* to finish layout for all possible states
* to try context menu for the rest of configuration of sooperlooper

TODO for old marijn's aproach:
* check if the logic of not firing up events if value didn't change is good or not
* standardize input/source in InputSignals (xrobot.py and the rest)
* find out how to solve problem when events like (keyboard) keys produce two events (1 and 0) which triggers unwanted actions like two osc messages (ie. record in sooperlooper)
* add read mouse position to InputSignals so mouse could be used as
  source
* start use pyliblo instead simpleosc as liblo is standard for osc these
  days
