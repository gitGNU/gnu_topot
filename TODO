* to check 'maximum recursion depth' when app.processEvents() in update* functions
* to make version where there is a master CycleTime so it is separated from loops
  * to make CycleTime ring for loop just in case it's cycle is different from master one
* to clean up git repository
* to come up with solution for updateMakeLoop and initOsc
* to finish QBrush's Qt.Dense3Pattern stuff for next_state and probably mute state
* to finish layout for all possible states
* to try context menu for the rest of configuration of sooperlooper

TODO for old marijn's aproach:
* check if the logic of not firing up events if value didn't change is good or not
* standardize input/source in InputSignals (xrobot.py and the rest)
* find out how to solve problem when events like (keyboard) keys produce two events (1 and 0) which triggers unwanted actions like two osc messages (ie. record in sooperlooper)
* add read mouse position to InputSignals so mouse could be used as
  source
* start use pyliblo instead simpleosc as liblo is standard for osc these
