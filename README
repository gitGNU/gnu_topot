Topot is python scripting environment to allow classic input devices,
gamepads/joysticks and midi/osc gears to mimic each other (to use
mouse/keyboard as midi/osc controlers and vice versa...)

Visualisations of the parameters in charge is an extra layer.

It allows user to use gamepad as mouse, keyboard or any other system
call written in xAction class. At the moment, there is also draft class
which allows user to use MIDI controller as a regular mouse.

Requirments:

 * http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~brinkman/software/pyseq/

You should have topot python files (+ requirments) in your PYTHONPATH
environment variable.
