// These should be added to PySec, because the library doesn't export
// event-reading functions, assuming you will always want to use its
// MidiThread for that.

// pysec.c:

void readEvent(snd_seq_t *seq_handle, snd_seq_event_t *event) {
  snd_seq_event_input(seq_handle, event);
}

// pysec.py, somewhere in the snd_seq_event class:

    def read(self, seq):
        libpysec.readEvent(seq, self)
